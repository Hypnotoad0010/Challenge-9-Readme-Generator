Readme Generator

This is a Readme Generator

I have modified the started code to make the app work with the help of old resources and google.

You can start the generator by first opening the develop folder into the terminal. Do an npm install. Once finished do an npm start. You will then be asked multiple questions that when finished will create a new readme into the new output folder. 

You should be able to view your new readme created with selected licence badge added in the new output folder. 

Please email me with any questions: IsaacHphotography@gmail.com
